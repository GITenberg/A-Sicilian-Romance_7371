description: "A Sicilian Romance is a gothic novel by Ann Radcliffe. It was her second\
  \ published work, and was first published anonymously in 1790.\nThe plot concerns\
  \ the fallen nobility of the house of Mazzini, on the northern shore of Sicily,\
  \ as related by a tourist who learns of their turbulent history from a monk he meets\
  \ at the ruins of their once-magnificent castle. The Mazzini sisters, Emilia and\
  \ Julia are 'beautiful' young ladies with many talents. Julia quickly falls in love\
  \ with the young and handsome Italian count Hippolitus de Vereza, but to her dismay\
  \ her father decides that she should marry Duke de Luovo instead. After much thought\
  \ Julia attempts to elope with Hippolitus on the night before her wedding. However,\
  \ their escape had been anticipated, and the Marquis, Julia's father, ambushes and\
  \ seemingly kills Hippolitus whose body is carried away by his servants. The Marquis\
  \ tells Julia that she must marry the duke and after much difficulty she escapes\
  \ again alone. The Marquis and the Duke spend much of the novel trying to catch\
  \ Julia and force her to marry the duke. Julia has to flee from her various hiding\
  \ places as she narrowly avoids capture and eventually ends up, by a secret tunnel,\
  \ in the abandoned and seemingly haunted southern apartments of the Mazzini castle\
  \ only to find that her mother, thought to be dead, had been imprisoned there for\
  \ years by the Marquis, who had grown to despise her. The Marquis's new wife, Maria\
  \ de Vellorno, commits murder-suicide after the Marquis discovers and accuses her\
  \ of infidelity, poisoning the Marquis and stabbing herself. Before he dies the\
  \ Marquis confesses to Ferdinand, his son, that his mother has been imprisoned,\
  \ and hands him the keys. However, his mother and Julia had already been freed by\
  \ Hippolitus, who had recovered from his wounds. Ferdinand then finds them at a\
  \ lighthouse on the coast, waiting to leave for Italy, and they are all joyfully\
  \ reunited. The introduction to the Oxford World's Classics edition notes that in\
  \ this novel \"Ann Radcliffe began to forge the unique mixture of the psychology\
  \ of terror and poetic description that would make her the great exemplar of the\
  \ Gothic novel, and the idol of the Romantics\". The novel explores the \"cavernous\
  \ landscapes and labyrinthine passages of Sicily's castles and convents to reveal\
  \ the shameful secrets of its all-powerful aristocracy\" [1].\n From Wikipedia (CC\
